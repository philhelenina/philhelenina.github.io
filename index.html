                <p>
                    I specialize in emotional AI, large language models, and human-robot interaction,
                    with a focus on developing empathetic conversational AI systems for healthcare applications.
                    Currently, I lead research on an emotion-aware caregiving robot designed to alleviate
                    agitation in dementia patients through conversation, while exploring LLM alignment and
                    agentic AI for more reliable and autonomous care interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research leverages computational linguistics, speech processing, and statistical modeling
                    to advance human-centered AI. I focus on unraveling the interplay between prosody and emotion
                    in human-machine interactions while prioritizing the development of safe, aligned autonomous AI systems.
                    I am particularly interested in neuro-symbolic reasoning, multimodal dataset creation, and
                    building robust frameworks for evaluating AI systems in real-world healthcare contexts.
