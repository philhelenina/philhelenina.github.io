                <p>
                    I specialize in emotional AI, large language models, and human-robot interaction,
                    with a focus on developing empathetic conversational AI systems for healthcare applications.
                    Currently, I lead research on an emotion-aware caregiving robot designed to alleviate
                    agitation in dementia patients through conversation, while exploring LLM alignment and
                    agentic AI for more reliable and autonomous care interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research leverages computational linguistics, speech processing, and statistical modeling
                    to advance human-centered AI. I focus on unraveling the interplay between prosody and emotion
                    in human-machine interactions while prioritizing the development of safe, aligned autonomous AI systems.
                    I am particularly interested in neuro-symbolic reasoning, multimodal dataset creation, and
                    building robust frameworks for evaluating AI systems in real-world healthcare contexts.

        <h3>Emotional Intelligence for Empathetic Patient-Robot Interaction</h3>
        <p>
            I lead the AI/ML development for an emotion-aware caregiving robot designed to support dementia patients and their caregivers.
            The robot uses generative AI and large language models to recognize agitation, predict potentially dangerous behaviors,
            and engage patients through personalized conversations. This work is supported by a $300,000 UCOP Noyce Initiative grant.
